## ‚úÖ Brief Testing Guidance

Once the application is running (using `npm start`), perform the following checks to ensure everything works as expected:

1.  **Task Addition:**
    * Type a task (e.g., "Buy groceries") into the input and click "Add Task."
    * **_Verify:_** The task appears in the list.
    * **_Negative Test:_** Try adding an empty task or a task with less than 3 characters.
    * **_Verify:_** Appropriate error messages appear.

2.  **Task Completion/Incompletion:**
    * Click the **checkbox** next to any task.
    * **_Verify:_** The task text gets a line-through, and its styling changes to indicate completion.
    * Click the checkbox again.
    * **_Verify:_** The line-through is removed, and the task reverts to an active state.

3.  **Task Removal:**
    * Click the **"Remove" button** next to any task.
    * **_Verify:_** The task instantly disappears from the list.

4.  **Data Persistence (Local Storage):**
    * Add a few tasks, mark some as complete, and remove others.
    * **Refresh your browser page** (`Ctrl/Cmd + R`).
    * **_Verify:_** All tasks and their statuses are retained exactly as you left them.

5.  **Filtering:**
    * Ensure you have a mix of active and completed tasks.
    * Use the **"Filter" dropdown** to select "Active Tasks," "Completed Tasks," and "All Tasks."
    * **_Verify:_** The list updates correctly to show only the selected category of tasks.

6.  **Sorting:**
    * Add tasks in a mixed order (e.g., "Zebra", then "Apple", then "Banana").
    * Use the **"Sort by" dropdown** to select "Sort Alphabetically."
    * **_Verify:_** Tasks are reordered alphabetically.
    * Select "Sort by Added Date."
    * **_Verify:_** Tasks are reordered by their creation time (newest first).

7.  **Visuals & Responsiveness:**
    * Observe the **animated background** and overall design.
    * **_Verify:_** The UI looks visually appealing and professional.
    * **Resize your browser window** to a smaller size (like a mobile device).
    * **_Verify:_** The layout adjusts gracefully, and elements remain well-aligned.
